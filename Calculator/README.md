To build and run the assembly code, use command "make" or "make all" while on
the micro-lab server, this should create an executable called "calc". To execute
a calculation, run ./calc followed by the calculation requested. For example:
 
./calc 4+2/10
 
would evaluate to 4.2000. If parenthesis are involved in the calculation,
include quotation marks around the argument. Ie...
 
./calc "20/(4+3)"                    


Spaces should be omitted between characters in the expression, and the program limits input to 19 characters.
